The provided script is currently set up for a binary classification task, meaning it is designed to classify inputs into one of two categories. If you want to modify this script to support n-dimensional output for multi-class classification, you will need to make several changes:

1. **Update the model to support multi-class output:** Currently, your model is set to output a single logit (as indicated by "num_classes": 1 in the model_params dictionary). You need to change this to the number of classes you want to predict. For instance, if you have three classes, you would set "num_classes": 3.

2. **Change the loss function:** The current loss function, BCEWithLogitsLoss, is suitable for binary classification. For multi-class classification, you should use CrossEntropyLoss instead, which combines a LogSoftMax layer and a negative log likelihood loss in one single class.

3. **Modify the accuracy function:** The current binary_accuracy function is designed for binary classification. For multi-class classification, you can calculate accuracy as the percentage of correct predictions.

4. **Update the prediction process:** Currently, the script uses torch.sigmoid to convert the model output to a probability. For multi-class classification, you should use torch.softmax instead, which will give you a probability distribution over the classes.

Here is how you could modify your script to support multi-class classification:

```python
# Change in the definition of model parameters
model_params = {
    "num_classes": n, # n is the number of classes
    "feature_size": 40, 
    "hidden_size": args.hidden_size,
    "num_layers": 1, 
    "dropout" :0.1, 
    "bidirectional": False
}

# Change in loss function
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# New accuracy function for multi-class classification
def multi_class_accuracy(preds, y):
    top_pred = preds.argmax(1, keepdim = True)
    correct = top_pred.eq(y.view_as(top_pred)).sum()
    acc = correct.float() / y.shape[0]
    return acc

# Modify the prediction process in the train function
def train(train_loader, model, optimizer, loss_fn, device, epoch):
    # ... existing code ...
    output = model(mfcc)
    # Get the probabilities from the model output
    pred = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    # ... remaining code ...

# Modify the prediction process in the test function
def test(test_loader, model, device, epoch):
    # ... existing code ...
    output = model(mfcc)
    # Get the probabilities from the model output
    pred = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    # ... remaining code ...
```

Please note that this is a general guide, and you will need to adjust it based on the specifics of your task and data [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66052668/binary-classification-with-pytorch), [Source 1](https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-a-binary-classification-model-in-pytorch/), [Source 10](https://www.learnpytorch.io/02_pytorch_classification/), [Source 13](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).
